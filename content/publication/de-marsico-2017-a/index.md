abstract: "© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. The paper investigates if\
  \ and how the topology of the peer-assessment network can affect the performance\
  \ of the Bayesian model adopted in OpenAnswer. Performance is evaluated in terms\
  \ of the comparison of predicted grades with actual teacher's grades. The global\
  \ network is built by interconnecting smaller subnetworks, one for each student,\
  \ where intra-subnetwork nodes represent student's characteristics, and peer assessment\
  \ assignments make up inter-subnetwork connections and determine evidence propagation.\
  \ A possible subset of teacher graded answers is dynamically determined by suitable\
  \ selection and stop rules. The research questions addressed are: (RQ1) “does the\
  \ topology (diameter) of the network negatively influence the precision of predicted\
  \ grades?”; in the affirmative case, (RQ2) “are we able to reduce the negative effects\
  \ of high-diameter networks through an appropriate choice of the subset of students\
  \ to be corrected by the teacher?” We show that (RQ1) OpenAnswer is less effective\
  \ on higher diameter topologies, (RQ2) this can be avoided if the subset of corrected\
  \ students is chosen considering the network topology."
