  Create your Lightning projects with ease: nn-template bootstraps projects enforcing reproducibility and best deep learning practices.

  PyTorch Lightning guides developers and researchers towards more organized and
  modular code writing. At the same time, it provides high-level functionalities and
  integrations with state-of-the-art tools. No compromise between easy of use and
  availability of features!
  Our project is about helping researchers bootstrapping their codebase, as shown by the
  several scientific publications that use it. Lightning is the main ingredient, it all revolves
  around it.
