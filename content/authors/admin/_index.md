I am a Ph.D. student at the Sapienza University of Rome in the Gladia research group led by Professor Emanuele Rodolà.

I'm excited by many Computer Science fields and, in particular, by *Artificial Intelligence*.
I am passionate about frontier research, crossing the boundaries of AI and other applied disciplines.
Currently, my research focuses on **geometric deep learning**, **representation learning**, and **reasoning**.

I'm a strong believer of reproducibility in science, and make an effort to write clean, well organized and documented code.
I strive to keep up to pace with the latest technological advancements and I like to think of myself as an early adopter.

I am a long time Linux user and open source enthusiast. When I can, I try to give back to the open-source community.
