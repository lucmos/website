I am a Ph.D. student at the Sapienza University of Rome in the Gladia research group led by Professor Emanuele Rodolà.

I'm excited by many Computer Science fields and, in particular, by *Artificial Intelligence*. Currently, my research focuses on **geometric deep learning**, **representation learning**, and **reasoning**.

I am a long time Linux user and open source enthusiast. When I can, I try to contribute back to the open-source community.
